I need to write an application i can feed text and get a table with every letter and the amount of them in the text back.

I think i will need 4 classes for this application.

-Main Class
-GUI class
-A counter class
-A graph building class

Creating the text input and GUI won't be hard. However i have no experience yet with creating tables.
What i think i might be able to do is count all the characters and save them in a HashMap, then build
a graph using the values in the HashMap.

I will be using a large text area, with a "Count" button below it.
When the button is clicked it will generate a new HashMap then using a for loop i will be looping through
every character in the text and counting the characters.

After this the HashMap will go to the Graph class where a graph is generated using the HashMap. This table will
then be displayed inside of the application.
